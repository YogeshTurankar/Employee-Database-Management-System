# Employee-Database-Management-System
My First Java GUI Project, this is java GUI project build using window builder in eclipse.
Sqlite database browser was used to create database.
If it gives connection error, please verify databse path in EmployeeData.java file & install sqlite db browser.

Open src folder and then run Employee.java class.


Below is a screenshot of application window.
